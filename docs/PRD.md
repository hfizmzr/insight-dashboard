# Product Requirements Document: AI Insight Dashboard

## Vision
A high-performance research tool that transforms raw text sources (transcripts, feedback, articles) into structured, visual insights using LLMs.

## Core User Stories (MVP)
1. **Source Input:** As a user, I can paste text or submit a URL (YouTube/Article) to be processed.
2. **AI Analysis:** As a user, I want the system to extract sentiment, key themes, and a 3-sentence summary.
3. **Visualization:** As a user, I want to see a dashboard with charts representing the data (e.g., sentiment pie chart, theme word cloud).
4. **History:** As a user, I want to view and search through my past analyses.

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)
* User accounts/Authentication (Local use only for now).
* Real-time collaborative editing.
* PDF file uploads.
